 Some time ago, on a need to call Java code from Rust, I started the j4rs project. The main idea was to implement a crate that would give the ability to its users to make calls to Java easily, so that they can benefit from the huge Java ecosystem.
By &amp;ldquo;easily&amp;rdquo;, I mean:
 Taking care about the configuration required by JNI (e.</description>
